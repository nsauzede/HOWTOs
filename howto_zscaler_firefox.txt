From IE, internet options, Content, Certificate
In Trusted root certification authorities, find the Zscaler certificate (4)
Export each Zscaler certificate in .cer file format
From Firefox, go to Tools,Option,Advanced,Certificates then View Certificates
Import the Zscaler certificates .cer files through the Import button
Maybe not all  (4) certificates are mandatory, but after that it works.
Be carreful when Importing in firefox to import as Root Authority and not as Server
If you have them in server list, remove them and then import as certificate authority.
then you need to reboot Firefox
